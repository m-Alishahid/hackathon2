# Figma Template to Next.js Conversion

## Project Overview

As a student of GIAIC (Generative AI Engineering of Governor Sindh IT Initiative), I participated in an individual 24-hour hackathon where I successfully converted a Figma design template into fully responsive Next.js code. This project highlights my skills in UI/UX design implementation, developing responsive websites, and working with modern web technologies under tight deadlines.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to take a professional Figma template and transform it into a fully responsive and interactive website using Next.js. The aim was to ensure the design was accurately represented, with a focus on performance, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building a dynamic, SEO-friendly web application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For streamlined styling and responsive design.
- **React Components**: To break down the Figma template into reusable, modular components.
- **Figma**: To extract design assets and replicate the layout in code.

## Process

### 1. Design Analysis
- Analyzed the Figma template to understand its layout, design principles, and user flow.
- Extracted key design elements like colors, typography, and spacing to ensure consistency in the final result.

### 2. Setting Up the Project
- Initialized a new Next.js project as the foundation.
- Installed necessary dependencies like Tailwind CSS to implement the design.

### 3. UI/UX Implementation
- Converted static Figma elements into React components.
- Used Tailwind CSS utility classes to implement a responsive layout for mobile and desktop views.

### 4. Optimization & Performance
- Implemented Next.js features like image optimization and lazy loading for faster load times.
- Used code splitting to enhance page load performance and user experience.

### 5. Testing and Deployment
- Tested the application across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
- Deployed the website on **Vercel**, using Next.js integration for seamless deployment.

## Outcome

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in converting Figma designs to fully functional web applications, and it enhanced my skills in modern front-end development. The project is a testament to my ability to translate static designs into dynamic, interactive websites.
